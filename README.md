Developed a stock price prediction model using yfinance data, achieving 71% accuracy in forecasting price movements. Engineered features such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to enhance model performance. Implemented data preprocessing techniques including MinMax scaling and SMOTE for balancing class distributions. Trained multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, with the Random Forest model yielding 69% precision and 64% recall. Evaluated and visualized the model's performance using comprehensive classification reports and confusion matrices to assess accuracy and classification metrics effectively.
